        <hr color="black" size="3">
        <p>The first thing that comes to every fans mind when we think of Percy is 
            <i>BLUE!!</i> and then the waves. <br>His character taught us how life is never ups, and most 
            of all the book and its characters have been an inspiration to all the readers.<br>
            It taught us to be with what we feel is good, don't let someone else make u feel weak.<br>
            <i><u>You are who you are and that is your power.</u></i>
            <br> This is something every percy jackson fandom learnt and is adapting to in real life.
